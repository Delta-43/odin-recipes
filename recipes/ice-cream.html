            <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
            <p>For about 700ml of Ice-Cream, you'll need - 
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>2 cups heavy cream</b> </li>
                    <li> <b>1 cup whole milk</b> </li>
                    <li> <b>⅔ cup granulated sugar</b> </li>
                    <li> <b>⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt</b> </li>
                    <li> <b>6 large egg yolks</b> </li>
                    <li> <b>Choice of flavoring</b> </li>                    
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Steps :</h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <p>In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes.
                        <br> Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the
                        <br> hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low
                        <br> heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
                        <br> (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li> <p>Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least
                        <br>4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturers’ instructions. Serve directly
                        <br>from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed. </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
